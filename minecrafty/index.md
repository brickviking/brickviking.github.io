## Welcome to the Minecrafty Pages.
This script is your one-stop-shop to downloading and executing common Minecraft launchers, as well as changing the environment they run in. If you want to download this script so you can keep it up to date, the following instructions will apply to you.

```
$ cd your_sourcecode_dir/
$ git clone http://github.com/brickviking/minecrafty
$ cd minecrafty
```
Read through the script so you can see what I've used as some sane defaults. Edit if you like, then put in somewhere into your $PATH so it can run. Don't forget to make it executable first.

## Authors and Contributors
I'm the principal developer, although I've had a little bit of help from others.
